# ClimateWins: Machine Learning for Climate Change Predictions

## Project Summary
ClimateWins, a European nonprofit organization, leverages machine learning to predict the consequences of climate change. This project aims to analyze historical weather data, uncover patterns, and forecast future climate conditions. By doing so, ClimateWins seeks to improve planning and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.

## Data Source
- **Provided by**: European Climate Assessment & Data Set (ECA&D)
- **File Types**: CSV and other weather-related formats
- **Key Information**:
  - Observations from 18 weather stations across Europe
  - Timeframe: Late 1800s to 2022
  - Variables include:
    - Daily temperature (mean, min, max)
    - Wind speed
    - Snowfall
    - Global radiation
